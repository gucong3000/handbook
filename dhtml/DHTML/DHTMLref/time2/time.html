<HR SIZE="1"></HR><p>HTML+TIME (Timed Interactive Multimedia Extensions), first released in Microsoft?Internet Explorer 5, adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML pages. Using a few Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based elements and attributes, you can add images, video, and sounds to an HTML page, and synchronize them with HTML text elements over a specified amount of time. In short, you can use HTML+TIME technology to quickly create multimedia-rich, interactive presentations, easily and with little or no scripting.</p><p>HTML+TIME 2.0 is based on the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/tr/2000/wd-smil-boston-20000622/html-smil-profile.html" TARGET="_top">HTML+SMIL language profile</A>&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="11" BORDER="0" ALT="Non-Microsoft link" SRC="../common/leave-ms.gif"> in the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/tr/smil20/" TARGET="_top">Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) 2.0</A>&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="11" BORDER="0" ALT="Non-Microsoft link" SRC="../common/leave-ms.gif"> working draft. <B>SMIL 2.0</B> is the W3C successor to SMIL 1.0.

For example, you can create slide-show-style Web presentations with synchronized text, images, audio, video, and streaming media. You can create these presentations so that they are timed, interactive, or a combination of both.</p><H3><A NAME="Benefit2"></A>Ease of Use</H3><p>To add timing to an HTML document, all you have to do is add some new attributes to existing HTML elements. Thus, you can leverage your existing HTML knowledge when you add timing to your page. The HTML+TIME attributes specify when an element appears on a page, how long it remains displayed, and how the surrounding HTML elements are affected. In addition to the attributes, some new XML-based elements have been created to simplify incorporating media into Web pages. For example, you can use the <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">excl</SPAN> element to specify when a sound file should start playing, when it should stop, and how many times it should repeat.</p><p>HTML elements can be grouped into hierarchical relationships to allow for easy manipulation of multiple HTML elements at once. Grouping is also used to specify whether HTML elements appear and disappear sequentially on the page, or use independent timing. Element grouping is specified either by using the <A HREF="../time2/elements/par.html">t:PAR</A>, <A HREF="../time2/elements/seq.html">t:SEQ</A>, or <A HREF="../time2/elements/excl.html">t:EXCL</A> elements in a document, or by setting the <A HREF="../time2/properties/timecontainer.html">TIMECONTAINER</A> attribute.</p><H3><A NAME="Benefit3"></A>Scripting Support</H3><p>With HTML+TIME, you can use persistent XML elements and attributes to add timing to your HTML page. This means you don't have to know how to program with scripting languages to make your pages more dynamic. However, for people who already know how to use scripting languages, HTML+TIME supports a complete object model that extends the existing DHTML Object Model. Thus, you can use HTML+TIME properties, methods, and events to add even more interactive features to your Web pages.</p><H2><A NAME="Behaviors"></A>HTML+TIME Behaviors and Elements</H2><p>HTML+TIME is implemented as a DHTML default behavior, one of the powerful new features introduced in Internet Explorer 5. For more information about behaviors, see the Related Topics section of this document.</p><p>You can use all the HTML+TIME attributes listed in the reference pages with any timed HTML element. For a list of HTML elements that can be timed, see the Applies To section of the <A HREF="../time2/time/behaviors/time.html">time</A> and <A HREF="../time2/behaviors/time2.html">time2</A> behavior reference pages.</p><H3><A NAME="update"></A>Internet Explorer 5.5 Update</H3><p>The <A HREF="../time2_entry.html">HTML+TIME 2.0 Reference</A> lists the features implemented by the <B>time2</B> behavior and supported in Internet Explorer 5.5 and later.</p><p>The <A HREF="../time2/time_entry.html">HTML+TIME 1.0 Reference</A> lists the features implemented by the <B>time</B> behavior and supported in Internet Explorer 5 and later.</p><H2><A NAME="Model"></A>HTML+TIME Timing Model</H2><p>Most traditional animation runtime systems use either rigid timelines or pure, event-based relationships to model time. The rigid timeline model makes it more difficult to create interactive content. In this environment, you must add "jumps" to another pseudo-timeline to introduce interactive elements. In event-based models, interaction is easier to define, but it is more difficult to create timeline behaviors, such as sequences and precise synchronization of media elements.</p><p>HTML+TIME unifies these two timing models, taking the best of each and simplifying the process of authoring timed, interactive content. In the HTML+TIME model, you can use timeline attributes to describe static, or determinate, timeline relationships. This makes it easy to place elements in time and to ensure synchronization among media elements. You can author interactive content using a simple variant on the timeline attributes, where the begin and/or end times are tied to an event. Therefore, the actual begin and/or end values are indeterminate when you author the document. In reality, these times are event-based, but they can be defined as though they had traditional timing. When the associated event occurs, such as a user clicking a button, the indeterminate timing relationship is defined by the time at which the event occurs. At this point, the element is added into the running timeline as though it had been defined from the beginning.</p><p>This unified model makes it easy to define an animation that has tightly synchronized media, and to add a number of interactive elements that start when the user does something. The interactive elements can have a duration and repeat count just like other timed elements, even though they begin in response to an event. You can apply a single set of tools for timing and synchronization to any element. This makes the model easier to learn and less complicated, without sacrificing any flexibility.</p><p>HTML+TIME defines a schedule, or timeline, for all the affected elements to follow. The document timeline starts as soon as the page loads and continues to progress as long as the browser renders the page. If timing is applied to media elements, such as audio or video files, you can specify that the timeline will be tightly synchronized with other elements or the entire document. By default, media files that are not ready to play when scheduled will slip along the timeline and begin playing as soon as they become available. You can pause and resume the document timeline using methods from the object model.</p><p>HTML elements behave differently when you add time attributes, depending on the HTML element type. Although other categories might exist for HTML elements, HTML+TIME primarily distinguishes between content and style elements. Content elements include all elements that describe content to be displayed on the page, including the media elements introduced with HTML+TIME (<A HREF="../time2/elements/animation.html">t:ANIMATION</A>, <A HREF="../time2/elements/audio.html">t:AUDIO</A>, <A HREF="../time2/elements/img.html">t:IMG</A>, <A HREF="../time2/elements/media.html">t:MEDIA</A>, and <A HREF="../time2/elements/video.html">t:VIDEO</A>. Commonly used content elements include <A HREF="../objects/p.html">p</A>, <A HREF="../objects/div.html">div</A>, <A HREF="../objects/span.html">span</A>, and table-related elements. Adding HTML+TIME attributes to a content element causes the element to appear and disappear over time. Style elements describe the style to be applied to an element. Commonly used style elements include <A HREF="../objects/b.html">b</A>, <A HREF="../objects/i.html">i</A>, and <A HREF="../objects/em.html">em</A>. Adding HTML+TIME attributes to a style element causes the style to be applied to and removed from the element over time. For more information about style elements, see the HTML+TIME Implementation Notes section of this document.</p><H2><A NAME="Authoring"></A>Authoring HTML+TIME</H2><p>Use the following steps to add timing to an HTML element.</p><UL><LI><A TARGET="_self" HREF="#Step1">Create an XML Namespace</A></LI><LI><A TARGET="_self" HREF="#Step2">Reference the time2 Behavior</A></LI><LI><A TARGET="_self" HREF="#Step3">Specify Beginning and Ending Times</A></LI><LI><A TARGET="_self" HREF="#Step4">Include an Action</A></LI></UL><H3><A NAME="Step1"></A>Create an XML Namespace</H3><p>When using any of the HTML+TIME elements, such as the <B>t:EXCL</B>, <B>t:SEQ</B> or <B>t:PAR</B> elements, you must declare the XML namespace <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">t:</SPAN> in the <A HREF="../objects/html.html">html</A> tag, as shown in the following line of code:</p><PRE CLASS="clsCode" AUTOHILITE="1">&lt;HTML XMLNS:t ="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:time"&gt;</PRE><p>To use the namespace, preface HTML+TIME elements with <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">t:</SPAN>. This string identifies the HTML+TIME elements as qualified XML namespace extensions. To establish <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">t:</SPAN> as the namespace, import the <B>time2</B> behavior into the namespace as shown in the following line of code:</p><PRE CLASS="clsCode" AUTOHILITE="1">&lt;?IMPORT namespace="t" implementation="#default#time2"&gt;</PRE><H3><A NAME="Step2"></A>Reference the time2 Behavior</H3><p>You must associate the element with the <B>time2</B> behavior, so that the element is affected by the document timeline.

Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to associate the <B>time2</B> behavior with HTML+TIME elements, such as <B>t:MEDIA</B>, <B>t:AUDIO</B>, and <B>t:VIDEO</B>, because they are defined by the behavior itself.</DIV><H3><A NAME="Step3"></A>Specify Beginning and Ending Times</H3><p>You must specify when the HTML element should appear and for how long. This is accomplished by including the <A HREF="../time2/properties/begin.html">BEGIN</A> and <A HREF="../time2/properties/end.html">END</A> attributes on the element. You can use the <A HREF="../time2/properties/dur.html">DUR</A> attribute instead of <B>END</B> to specify an ending time relative to the element's <B>BEGIN</B> time. However, there is no functional difference between <B>END</B> and <B>DUR</B>, so you can use either one. If you do not set a <B>BEGIN</B>, <B>END</B>, or <B>DUR</B> time, the default value causes an element to begin displaying when the page loads, and the element remains displayed indefinitely. Therefore, the element appears static, as though you have not set any timing on that element.</p><p>The following sample shows lines of text that appear every two seconds and remain displayed for five seconds.</p><PRE CLASS="clsCode" AUTOHILITE="1">&lt;HTML&gt;

In the DHTML Object model, two properties are available on the <A HREF="../objects/obj_style.html">style</A> object for turning on and off the display of an element. HTML+TIME changes the value of these properties over time. With DHTML, you can set the <A HREF="../properties/visibility.html">visibility</A> property to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">hidden</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">visible</SPAN>. This property reserves space in the layout of the rendered document, as though the element is always visible. Therefore, the document does not reflow its contents as elements are dynamically displayed or hidden.</p><p>The default behavior for using HTML+TIME on a content element is <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">TIMEACTION="visibility"</SPAN>. In contrast, when the DHTML <A HREF="../properties/display.html">display</A> attribute is set to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">none</SPAN> it does not reserve space in the rendered document. Therefore, the document reflows every time the value of the <B>display</B> attribute changes. To reflow the document using HTML+TIME, set the <B>TIMEACTION</B> attribute to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">display</SPAN>.</p><p>As an alternative to displaying and hiding an element, you can set the <B>TIMEACTION</B> attribute to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">style</SPAN> to make an inline style active on an element. If you use this option, any style property included on the element using the <B>STYLE</B> attribute is applied only while the element is active on the timeline; otherwise, the inline style is ignored. As of Internet Explorer 5.5, you can also modify the style of an element by specifying one or more class names for the <B>TIMEACTION</B> attribute.</p><p>When using a time container, you can set the <B>TIMEACTION</B> attribute to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">none</SPAN> so that it performs no action. When this attribute is set to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">none</SPAN>, only the child elements of the time container are visually affected while the timeline is active. If an element supports a Boolean <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">on</SPAN> property, you can use a <B>TIMEACTION</B> value of <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">onOff</SPAN> to make the <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">on</SPAN> property <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">true</SPAN> while the timeline is active on the element, or <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">false</SPAN> otherwise.</p><p>The following sample shows lines of text that appear every two seconds and remain displayed for five seconds. This is similar to the previous sample, but in this case the document reflows, as necessary, because the <B>TIMEACTION</B> attribute is set to <SPAN CLASS="clsLiteral">display</SPAN>.
